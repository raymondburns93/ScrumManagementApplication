# ScrumManagementApplication

This is a scrum management application implemented using a client-server architecture. The project was undertaken during the Fall 2015 semester as a requirement of my course module "Agile & Component Based Development using .NET".

This was a team based development using the Scrum Framework approach. There were 5 other members on my team. Development took place over 2 sprints, with each lasting 2 weeks.

I predominantly worked server side and first introduced the layered architecture. I introduced Entity Framework and did most of its setup and configuration.
