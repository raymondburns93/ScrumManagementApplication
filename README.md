# ScrumManagementApplication

This is a scrum management application implemented using a client-server architecture. The project was undertaken during the Fall 2015 semester for my "Agile & Component Based Development using .NET" course module.

This was a team based development using the Scrum Framework approach. There were 5 other members on my team. Development took place over 2 sprints, with each lasting 2 weeks.

I predominantly worked server side and first introduced the layered architecture. I introduced Entity Framework and did all of its setup and configuration.

For some examples of specific code contributions, please see

[Generic Repository](trunk/ScrumManagementApp/ScrumManagementApp.DAL/Repository/GenericRepository.cs)
[business layer example](trunk/ScrumManagementApp/ScrumManagementApp.Business/ProductBacklogLogic.cs)

This was both a challenging and rewarding project. I was introduced to new .NET technologies and got to learn how to use Entity Framework. This was my first experience working with an Object Relational Mapper.
